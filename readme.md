# Summary

This repository contains the content of my personal blog at https://dh1tw.de

The content is written in Markdown. The HTML documents are generated by
the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The theme I chose ([hugo-tranquilpeak-theme](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme))
is included as a git submodule.

In order to deploy the website, the `/public` folder is rsynced to one of my VPS
where the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) webserver serves the files.

```
$ hugo && rsync -avz --delete public/ www-data@myserver.com:~/var/www/mysite
```
