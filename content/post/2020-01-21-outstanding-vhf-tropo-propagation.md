The year 2020 started with outstanding tropospheric VHF propagation here in southern Germany. For the first time, I was able to copy the VHF beacon [GB3NGI](https://www.qsl.net/gb3ngi) from Northern Irland at a stunning distance of 1300km. Read more about this great opening and listen to the audio recording I made.

## VHF propagation phenomenons

Radio signal propagation on [VHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_high_frequency) is normally limited to a few hundred kilometers, at most. However, sometimes extraordinary physical effects extend temporarily the effective range well above 1000km. The two most common effects are:

1. [Sporadic-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporadic_E_propagation), when radio waves are reflected on small patches of unusually dense ionization within the E-layer of the ionosphere.
2. [Tropospheric propagation](http://www.dxinfocentre.com/propagation/tr-modes.htm), when layers of hot/cold air create ducts or cause refraction.

## Beacons

In a nutshell, [radio beacons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_beacon) are automated transmitters with a known location. They are used heavily in navigation, but also Amateur radio operators rely on them as indicators for extraordinary propagation. In Europe, we, fortunately, have a respective amount of [active VHF/UHF/SHR radio beacons](http://www.dl8wx.de/bakenukw.htm). Most amateur radio beacons operate with modest power (1 - 20 watts) and omnidirectional or large beamwidth antennas.

## My setup

My setup for 144 MHz is *average*. I have a single directional [11el Yagi antenna on a 6m long boom](https://www.antennas-amplifiers.com/2-meter-11-element-low-noise-antenna-144mhz-yagi) just two meters above the roof. The station is located in the [Maidenhead locator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System) JN48QM at 700m above sea level. I am lucky to have a free takeoff with no obstacles in all directions.

## My lucky morning

While on a *normal* day I copy between 2-3 beacons, in the early morning hours of 01.01.2020 I was able to copy a total of **8 radio beacons** at the same time.

Here is the list of the beacons I was able to copy:

Frequency   | Beacon | Location | Distance
------------|--------|----------|---------
144.404 MHz | DB0THE | JO51EL   | 336km
144.414 MHz | DB0JW  | JO40EK   | 303km
144.435 MHz | DB0LBV | JO61EH   | 377km
144.444 MHz | DB0FGB | JO50WB   | 249km
144.454 MHz | DB0MMO | JN49RV   | 153km
144.463 MHz | DF0ANN | JN59PL   | 175km
144.474 MHz | DB0HRF | JO40FF   | 175km
**144.482 MHz** | **GB3NGI**  | **IO65VB** | **1290km**

GB3NGI was the biggest surprise at a stunning distance of almost 1300km. Find below the recorded audio:

I'm licensed now for more than 20 years, but this was the first time that I was able to observe such outstanding VHF Tropo propagation. I guess 2020 started great for me!
