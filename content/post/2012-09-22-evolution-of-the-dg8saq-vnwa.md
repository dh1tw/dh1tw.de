With his low cost, high precision Vector Network Analyzer, Tom (DG8SAQ) started a revolution in Ham Radio. Thanks to his efforts, amateur (and professional!) enthusiasts have now the possibility to perform measurements which were reserved to well funded HF laboratories before. In this video, Tom explains the evolution and capabilities of his VNWA and why even NASA relies on it now as well!

The presentation was held during the Ham Radio Hamfest in Friedrichshafen, Germany in June 2012. Tom is speaking in German, but [Kurt Poulsen, OZ7OU][2] has translated it into English!
