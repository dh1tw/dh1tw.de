During my stay in Ecuador I was able to operate two days under my US Callsign as HC2/AL1O. Special thanks to my host Alberto, HC2AQ who offered me his shack. Within two days, 1700 QSOs found their way into the log.

Read on for pictures, online log & QSL information.

## Operation

During my stay I tried to work on all bands from 10m down to 80m. I had great pileups on 15m and 20m from JA and the US. In the evening I enjoyed very much the operation on 80m CW. During the time of the European sunrise (06:00Z - 08:00Z) I worked EU, NA, JA and ZL at the same time!

## Online Log & LoTW

Thanks to everyone who gave me a call. The check your callsign in the online log below. The log will soon be submitted to LOTW as well.

Check out the Log & request your QSL card [here][1]

## QSL Cards

In case you are interested in a QSL card please request it through the [Clublog OQSL system](https://secure.clublog.org/logsearch/HC2/AL1O). The more expensive way is to send it to [my address](https://qrz.com/db/dh1tw). If you can wait, then send it through the buro via my German Callsign DH1TW.

## Pictures

Here are a few pictures of the operation:

[HD2A](https://qrz.com/db/hd2a) operate from the station. If you hear them the next time, give them a call!
