The community of Flex-Radio enthusiasts which select the DJ Console as their main user interface is steadily growing. Community members are [sharing pictures][2] to make it even better. After several labeling solutions, a recent discussion on the [PowerSDR-UI Yahoogroup][3] ended up in an haptic improvement for the DJ Console's tuning wheels.

## Why improving the tuning wheels?

From our classic radios we are used that the main tuning wheel comes with a flying wheel effect. The DJ console's big turning wheel however are pretty light and have very little flying wheel effect.

## The solution

This is what brought Ray, [Jerry (W3JJJ)][4] and [Marc (W3MDJ)][5] on the idea of modifying the DJ Console by adding [plasticine / modelling clay](https://www.amazon.com/Plasticine-Classic-Color-Play-Visions/dp/B002IXS54A?SubscriptionId=AKIAJ5QWBEHH74OEJ46Q&tag=dhde-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B002IXS54A) inside the tuning wheels.

Marc, W3MDJ did also a great job of documenting the [DJ Console modification][6] on his website.
