At our Contest Station [ED1R][1] we are limited in space. Therefore we have to
install before the contests our low band verticals and beverages - and of course
after the contests, take them down and bring them into the storage again. Over
the last years we started optimizing the way [how to rapidly deploy and remove radials][2].
Earlier we used a bunch of garden hose carts, which were inexpensive, but after
three contest seasons, they started falling appart. A more solid solution was
needed. This time we build a solid cart, using surplus military equipment.

## The cart

The base cart we got from Ebay. It was a cheap chinese one for around 80€. It
claims to be build for 350kg, which is IMHO exagerated. But for our purpose
it is adequate.

## Winch & Coilers

Again, back on ebay we got from a German Powerseller a surplus (ex military)
mounting for for coilers. We paid approximately 40€ per coiler, including 700m
of robust military field wire (**LFK** - _Leichtes Feld Kabel_).

## Main Frame

We designed the main frame for a convenient working height. We got the 2mm steal
from our local locksmith and soldered them in an afternoon. Afterwards we painted
them twice to avoid oxidation. The frame itself just fits perfectly into the cart
with no need for soldering or screwing them together. This _drop in_ system also
allows us to replace the cart, in case it breaks one day, or just to use it
without the frame for other purposes.

# Summary

So far the cart is now in use for more than a year and apart of one flat tire,
we haven't had any further problems. We deploy now 4 beverages (each 250m long)
and about 3km of radial network for the 80m and 160m antennas in less than 2 hours.
