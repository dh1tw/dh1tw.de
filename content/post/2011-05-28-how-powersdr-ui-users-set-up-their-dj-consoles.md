# Join the community
If you are looking for knobs and buttons to control your SDR transceiver, then I highly recommend to join the [PowerSDR-UI Yahoogroup](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PowerSDR-UI). The community will be happy to answer questions and discuss User Interface related topics with you.

Within the Yahoogroup users also have uploaded pictures which show exactly how they use the DJ Console to control any FlexRadio.

Here are some examples of pictures and videos which have been created by individuals of the PSDR-UI community:
