Over the last 8 months, I was digging deep into Web Development. The result went yesterday public, [DXHeat.com][1]. Instead of building just another Web DX Cluster, I tried to build something innovative with new, unique features. The best is to check it out by yourself!

<!--more-->

Within the first 48 hours, the site received more than 3000 visitors. [DXHeat.com][1] was featured on a couple of blogs and I was retweeted almost 100 times! So I'm very happy how well [DXHeat.com][1] was received in the Amateur Radio community. At the last minute before the public launch, I added an easily accessible feedback form. I'm glad I did! I received more than 20 comments with valuable feedback, reporting small bugs and requesting new features.

**So let me quote the most important (unique) features of [DXHeat.com][1]:**

  * Graphical representation of band activity vs continents
  * Integration with WebSDR
  * DX Analytics with plenty of diagrams for all callsigns spotted since 2001
  * Flexible, but easy to use filters
  * Responsive Design, looks good on phone, tables, and Desktops
  * Spots are pushed in realtime into the browser

## Attribution

This project would have never been possible without the contribution of:

  * [Javier, EC4DX][2] who provided a copy of [DXfuncluster.com][3] fine database
  * [Pieter-Tjerk, PA3FWM][4] who provided an interface to his WebSDR
  * [Hardy, DL1GLH][5] for his extensive beta Testing
  * [Django][6] an awesome Web Framework, written in [Python][7]
  * [Jim, AD1C and Kristen, K6WX][8] for maintaining the Country Files in such a variety of formats
